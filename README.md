# Lunar-Lander-DQN

Solving the environment: Lunar Lander with a Deep Q Network implemented from scratch using PyTorch. 

I made this notebook to run in the Google Colab environment. Setting it up locally will differ for every system due to the graphics of openAI gym environments.

To-do:
- [ ] Add checkpoint saving and loading for training too. As of now its only added for seeing the performance of the model later at some milestones.
